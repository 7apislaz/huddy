## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- **New emotion: `excited`** — triggers at 5+ consecutive successes (distinct from `happy`); all 12 characters have dedicated frames with star eyes `★`, sparkles `✦`, and max tail/energy
- **New character: Biscuit (dog)** — floppy `q`/`p` ears, `w` nose, tongue `J` on happy/excited, wagging `~` tail; loyal and energetic
- **New character: Mochi (hamster)** — iconic `>( )<` cheek pouches, sitting front pose, round `(°)(°)` ears, arms up on happy; curls into a ball when tired

### Changed
- **HUD layout** — `ctx` and `ses` combined on one line; `5h` and `7d` combined on one line (6 lines → 4 lines); `session:` label shortened to `ses:`
- **`huddy setup`** — now displays a character preview immediately after registering, before the restart prompt

### Added (commands)
- **`huddy hud`** — toggle HUD on/off with a single command (previously required `huddy config set hud off/on`)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- **Tamagotchi persistence** — happiness, consecutive error/success counters saved in `~/.huddy/state.json` across sessions
- **Reunion detection** — happy reaction when returning after 6+ hours away
- **State-based emotion triggers** — low happiness (<25) → sad, 5+ consecutive successes → high-intensity happy, 5+ consecutive errors → max-intensity sad
